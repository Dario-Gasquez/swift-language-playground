/*:
 - note: This behavior is due to structures being value types. When an instance of a value type is marked as a constant, so are all of its properties. The same is not true for classes, which are reference types. If you assign an instance of a reference type to a constant, you can still change that instanceâ€™s variable properties.
 */

//: ### Lazy Stored Properties
/*:
 - note: a lazy stored properties is a property whose initial value is not calculated until the first time it is used. You must always declare a lazy property as a variable (with the var keyword), because its initial value might not be retrieved until after instance initialization completes. Constant properties must always have a value before initialization completes, and therefore cannot be declared as lazy.

 - Important: If a lazy property is accessed by multiple threads simultaneously and the property has not yet been initialized, there is no guarantee that the property will be initialized only once.

//: ## Global and Local Variables
/*:
 - note: Global constants and variables are always computed lazily, in a similar manner to Lazy Stored Properties. Unlike lazy stored properties, global constants and variables do not need to be mareked with the 'lazy' keyword. Local constants and variables are never computed lazily.
 */


//: ## Type Properties
/*:
 - note: Unlike stored instance properties, stored type properties must always have a default value. This is because the type itself does not have an initializer that can assign a value to a stored type property at initialization time. Stored type properties are lazily initialized on their first access. They are guaranteed to be initialized only once, even when accessed by multiple threads at the same time, and they do not need to be marked with the 'lazy' modifier.
 */

//: ### Type Property Syntax
// Use the 'static' keyword to define a type property. For computed properties the 'class' keyword can be used instead to give subclasses the change to override the superclass's implementation.
