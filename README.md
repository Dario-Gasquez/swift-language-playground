# The Swift Language Playground

## Description
A playground created from Apple's [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html). Added a new 4.2 playground to avoid overwritting the 4.1 version (in case we want to compare differences).
