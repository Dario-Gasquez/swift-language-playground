please your Majesty?" he asked.

// String literals can contain special characters. Examples:
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
let dollarSign = "\u{24}"
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}"
//: ### Extended String Delimiters
//: Use of number sign (#) to include special characters without invoking their effect.
print(#"Line 1\nLine 2"#)

//: Swift 5 addition: It is possible to use extended string delimiters to include characters that would be interepreted as a String interpolation
print(#"Write an interpolated string in Swift using \(multiplier)."#)

//: ## Unicode
//: ### Unicode Scalar Values
/*:
Behind the scenes, Swift's native String type is build from *Unicode scalar values* which are unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier. NOT all 21-bit values are assigned, some are reseved for future uses or UTF-16 encoding.
 */

//: ### Extended Grapheme Clusters
/*:
 - note: Every Character instance represents a single extended grapheme cluster: a sequence of 1 or more Unicode scalars that combined produce a single human-readable character. */
// example, 2 ways to represent √©
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}" // e character plus accent

//: ## Character counting
var word = "cafe"
print("characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")

//Note: not always modifying a String changes its count
word += "\u{301}" //combinging Acute accent: U+0301
print("# of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")

/*:
 - note: Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. This means that different characters ‚Äî and different representations of the same character ‚Äî can require different amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift do not each take up the same amount of memory within a string‚Äôs representation. As a result, the number of characters in a string cannot be calculated without iterating through the string to determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, be aware that the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine the characters for that string. The count of the characters returned by the count property is not always the same as the length property of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit code units within the string‚Äôs UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.

//: ## Accessing and Modifying a String

//: ### String Indices

print("\(catString[catString.startIndex]) at \(catString.startIndex)")

catString.startIndex
catString.endIndex
let index = catString.index(catString.startIndex, offsetBy: 4)
catString[index]

for index in catString.indices {
    print("index: \(index). Character at index: \(catString[index])")
}

//: ### Inserting and removing
// Insert
var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex) //insert a character
welcome.insert(contentsOf: " the end", at: welcome.endIndex)

//Remove
welcome.remove(at: welcome.startIndex) //remove char at index
print(welcome)

let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -3)..<welcome.endIndex //remove substring
welcome.removeSubrange(range)

//: ## Substrings
/*:
 - note: When you get a substring from a string ‚Äîfor example, using a subscript or a method like `prefix(_:)` ‚Äî the result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings like strings. Unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String. For example
 */
let greeting = "Hello, Earth"
let greetingIndex = greeting.index(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
var beginning = greeting[..<index]
beginning.remove(at: beginning.startIndex)
print(beginning)
print(greeting)

//Convert 'beginning' substring to String for long-term storage.
let beginningString = String(beginning)

/*:
 - note: Both String and Substring conform to the StringProtocol protocol. If you‚Äôre writing code that manipulates string data, accepting a StringProtocol value lets you pass that string data as either a String or Substring value.
 */

//: ## Comparing strings
//: Swift provides 3 ways to compare textual values: string & character equality, prefix equality and suffix equality

//: ### String and Character Equality
let aString = "a string"
let anotherString = "a string"
if aString == anotherString {
    print("strings are equal")
}

// Canonically equivalent strings ----
let acuteCafe = "Caf√©"
let combinedAcuteCafe = "Caf\u{65}\u{301}"
if acuteCafe == combinedAcuteCafe {
    print("strings are cannonically equivalent (they have the same linguistic meaning)")
}

// Similar characters but not equivalent (Latin A vs. Cyrillic A) ---
let latinA = "\u{41} letter"
let cyrillicA = "\u{0410} letter"
if latinA != cyrillicA {
    print("non equivalent")
}

/*:
 - Note: String and character comparisons in Swift are not locale-sensitive
 */

//: ### Prefix and Suffix equality
let romeoAndJuliet = [
    "Act 1 Scene 1: Verona, A public place",
    "Act 1 Scene 2: Capulet's mansion",
    "Act 1 Scene 3: A room in Capulet's mansion",

    "Act 2 Scene 2: Capulet's orchard",

    if scene.hasPrefix("Act 1") {
        scenesInAct1 += 1
    }

//hasSuffix can be used in a similar what to check for string suffix equality
var scenesInACell = 0
for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
    if scene.hasSuffix("cell") { scenesInACell += 1 }
}
print("Scenes in a cell: \(scenesInACell)")
/*:
 - Note: The `hasPrefix(_:)` and `hasSuffix(_:)` methods perform a character-by-character canonical equivalence comparison between the extended grapheme clusters in each string, as described in String and Characters Equality.
